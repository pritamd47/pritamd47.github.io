Hi, I am a PhD candidate at the University of Washington, Seattle. 

My background is in hydrology, remote sensing, and geology.
I am interested in the application of state-of-art of remote sensing and computational modeling in water security, water resource management, and improving our understanding of the human footprint on Earth.

I grew up in different parts of the North East region of India. I completed my integrated masters in geological technology from IIT Roorkee, where I was exposed to the field of remote sensing and its applications on improving our understanding of Earth's cryosphere. I continued to pursue my interest in applications of remote sensing to improve our understainding of the Earth during my doctoral studies at the University of Washington.

My research work entails building open-source tools to quantify global water storage dynamics by cloud computing satellite remote sensing and distributed hydrological modeling.

Apart from research, I enjoy hiking, clicking pictures, and occasionally strumming my guitar.

Here is a link to my instagram page [m.ildly_aesthetic](https://www.instagram.com/m.ildly_aesthetic/) where I post mildly aesthetic pictures taken by me (submissions welcome!).
